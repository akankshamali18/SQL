The ORDER BY keyword is used to sort the result-set in ascending or descending order

SELECT * FROM Products
ORDER BY Price;
//sorts price by ascending order because default is ascending

SELECT * FROM Products
ORDER BY Price DESC;
//Sort the products from highest to lowest price:


SELECT * FROM Customers
ORDER BY Country ASC, CustomerName DESC;
