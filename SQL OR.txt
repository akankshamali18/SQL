The OR operator is used to filter records based on more than one condition, like if you want to return all customers from Germany but also those from Spain:

SELECT *
FROM Customers
WHERE Country = 'Germany' OR Country = 'Spain';


Select only the customers that are NOT from Spain:
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE NOT Country = 'Spain';

Select customers that does not start with the letter 'A':
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName NOT LIKE 'A%';

Select customers with a customerID not between 10 and 60:
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerID NOT BETWEEN 10 AND 60;

Select customers that are not from Paris or London:
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City NOT IN ('Paris', 'London');

Select customers with a CustomerId not greater than 50:
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE NOT CustomerID > 50;

Select customers with a CustomerID not less than 50:
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE NOT CustomerId < 50;
