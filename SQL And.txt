The AND operator is used to filter records based on more than one condition, like if you want to return all customers from india that starts with the letter 'U':

SELECT *
FROM Customers
WHERE Country = 'India' AND CustomerName LIKE 'U%';


SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country = 'Japan' AND (CustomerName LIKE 'c%' OR CustomerName LIKE 'j%');
